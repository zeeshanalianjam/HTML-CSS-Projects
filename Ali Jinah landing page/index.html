            <p>Father of the Nation Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah's achievement as the founder of Pakistan, dominates
                everything else he did in his long and crowded public life spanning some 42 years. Yet, by any standard,
                his was an eventful life, his personality multidimensional and his achievements in other fields were
                many, if not equally great. Indeed, several were the roles he had played with distinction: at one time
                or another, he was one of the greatest legal luminaries India had produced during the first half of the
                century, an `ambassador of Hindu-Muslim unity, a great constitutionalist, a distinguished
                parliamentarian, a top-notch politician, an indefatigable freedom-fighter, a dynamic Muslim leader, a
                political strategist and, above all one of the great nation-builders of modern times</p>
